%
%MkSgateData creates a time series of (Length) seconds with 2 peaks in its frequency spectrum.
%
%Inputs
%   Length: the length in seconds, of the required data
%   dt: the data aquisition rate, in seconds
%   PeakX1: the frequency of the first oscillator
%   PeakY1: the power of the first oscillator in units*seconds
%   STD1: the width factor of the Gaussian creating Peak1
%   Phase1: Phase (in radians) of the first peak
%   PeakX2, PeakY2, STD2, Phase2: same as for 1
%
%Outputs
%   SgateData: The time series
%%
%Notes: 
%Maybe add some noise to the phase.
%This phase does NOT model time delay. it assumes a driving 'oscillator'
%that has a certain phase.
