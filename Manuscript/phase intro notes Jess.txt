Phase shift, or lag-time, between two related signals is an important physiological parameter that may offer insight into pathophysiological conditions.  


The oscillations of blood pressure and heart rate are often compared using cross-spectral analyses to quantify baroreflex function.  The phase shift between blood pressure and heart rate is lengthened in some pathophysiological conditions.  


Sometimes it can be more tangible to report absolute time lag (in time units), which depends on the frequency of oscillations and relative phase shift (in degrees).
