@book{claerbout_fundamentals_1985,
	Abstract = {This book is about the use of computer programs for the analysis of geophysical data to try to determine the constitution of the Earth's interior, a process which enables a geophysicist to locate petroleum and mineral prospects. Traditional concepts of data processing are thoroughly discussed to provide a good foundation on the subject. The general theory of mathematical-physical computations in stratified media leads to computational techniques for two- and three-dimensionally heterogeneous media. A feature of the book is the use of partial differential equations for reflection seismic data processing in petroleum prospecting. Professor Claerbout and his students have originated a great deal of this material, which thus cannot be found in any other book.},

@article{halamek_variability_2003,
	Abstract = {Background--- We postulated that the variability of the phase shift between blood pressure and heart rate fluctuation near the frequency of 0.10 Hz might be useful in assessing autonomic circulatory control.
Methods and Results--- We tested this hypothesis in 4 groups of subjects: 28 young, healthy individuals; 13 elderly healthy individuals; 25 patients with coronary heart disease; and 19 patients with a planned or implanted cardioverter-defibrillator ({ICD} recipients). Data from 5 minutes of free breathing and at 2 different, controlled breathing frequencies (0.10 and 0.33 Hz) were used. Clear differences (P{\textless}0.001) in variability of phase were evident between the {ICD} recipients and all other groups. Furthermore, at a breathing frequency of 0.10 Hz, differences in baroreflex sensitivity (P{\textless}0.01) also became evident, even though these differences were not apparent at the 0.33-Hz breathing frequency.
Conclusions--- The frequency of 0.10 Hz represents a useful and potentially important one for controlled breathing, at which differences in blood {pressure--RR} interactions become evident. These interactions, whether computed as a variability of phase to define stability of the blood pressure--heart rate interaction or defined as the baroreflex sensitivity to define the gain in heart rate response to blood pressure changes, are significantly different in patients at risk for sudden arrhythmic death. In young versus older healthy individuals, only baroreflex gain is different, with the variability of phase being similar in both groups. These measurements of short-term circulatory control might help in risk stratification for sudden cardiac death.},

@article{tonhajzerova_cardiac_2011,
	Abstract = {The importance of the vagus nerve in the two way communication between the brain and the heart has been known for over 100 years. Recently, integrative theories that link central nervous system structures to cardiac vagal regulation, such as the polyvagal theory, have of late emerged. Based on the polyvagal theory, the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (as an index of cardiac vagal control) is considered as a psychophysiological marker of many aspects of behavioural functioning and emotion regulation in both children and adults. Although a lack of sensitive heart rate autonomic control likely reflects impaired cardiac nervous system regulation, the sophisticated brain-heart interactions are incompletely understood. Importantly, cardiac vagal dysregulation is associated with the increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity reflecting various pathophysiological states. Thus, we believe that the identifying of cardiac vagal control changes in mental disorders should represent an initial step towards the understanding of a potential pathomechanisms leading to later cardiac adverse outcomes; especially in children and adolescents.},

@article{ottesen_modelling_1997,
	Abstract = {The cardiovascular system is considered. A direct modelling of the non-linear baroreflex-feedback mechanism, including time-delay, is developed based on physiological theory and empirical facts. The feedback model is then evaluated on an expanded, but simple, non-pulsatile Windkessel model of the cardiovascular system. The stability of the entire model is analyzed and the effect of the value of the time-delay is investigated and discussed. The time-delay may cause oscillations. A finite number of stability switches may occur dependent on the value of the time-delay. The location of these stability switches turns out to be sensitive to the value of the parameters in the model. We suggest a simple experiment to determine whether or not the time-delay is responsible for the 10 second Mayer waves. Data from an ergometer bicycle test is used for evaluation of the model.},

@article{muller_estimation_2003,
	Abstract = {The problem of delay time estimation in biological systems is addressed with the focus on practical applicability of methods. Four delay time estimators are described: a cross correlation method and three increasingly sophisticated interpretations of the phase spectrum, ranging from a pointwise interpretation of the phase spectrum in terms of a delay to a Hilbert transform method. The four methods are compared through simulation studies showing that, in general, the Hilbert transform method performs best. The methods are then used to estimate delay times in three physiological systems: vestibular stimulation, cerebral autoregulation, and human orthostatic tremor. In all three cases, the Hilbert transform method yields the best results, leading in some cases to physiologically more sensible interpretations of experiments than the other methods. {\copyright} 2003 Biomedical Engineering Society. {PAC2003:} 8710+e, {8780Tq}},
