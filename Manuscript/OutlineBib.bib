@article{ottesen_modelling_1997,
	Abstract = {The cardiovascular system is considered. A direct modelling of the non-linear baroreflex-feedback mechanism, including time-delay, is developed based on physiological theory and empirical facts. The feedback model is then evaluated on an expanded, but simple, non-pulsatile Windkessel model of the cardiovascular system. The stability of the entire model is analyzed and the effect of the value of the time-delay is investigated and discussed. The time-delay may cause oscillations. A finite number of stability switches may occur dependent on the value of the time-delay. The location of these stability switches turns out to be sensitive to the value of the parameters in the model. We suggest a simple experiment to determine whether or not the time-delay is responsible for the 10 second Mayer waves. Data from an ergometer bicycle test is used for evaluation of the model.},

@article{muller_estimation_2003,
	Abstract = {The problem of delay time estimation in biological systems is addressed with the focus on practical applicability of methods. Four delay time estimators are described: a cross correlation method and three increasingly sophisticated interpretations of the phase spectrum, ranging from a pointwise interpretation of the phase spectrum in terms of a delay to a Hilbert transform method. The four methods are compared through simulation studies showing that, in general, the Hilbert transform method performs best. The methods are then used to estimate delay times in three physiological systems: vestibular stimulation, cerebral autoregulation, and human orthostatic tremor. In all three cases, the Hilbert transform method yields the best results, leading in some cases to physiologically more sensible interpretations of experiments than the other methods. {\copyright} 2003 Biomedical Engineering Society. {PAC2003:} 8710+e, {8780Tq}},
